# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Data is a collection of kickstarter funding projects, their initial goal, number of backers, time frame of fundraiser, and their success or failure.

### Purpose
Client Louis has asked to compare the kickstarter fundraisers to her play "Fever" fundraiser and offer advice on future fundraising.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis here was used with data supplied from kickstarter 
on multiple different fundraisers in multiple categories, and demonstrated some elements that are believed to influence the outcomes of each fundraisers.
Data supplied in an excel worksheet was sorted and organized, some calculated fields were added to help with analytics. 
Several pivot charts and graphs are also created to assist in visual analytics.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Below is a visulization to demonstrate weather a theater type fundraiser successful, failed, or was canceled compared to the month in which they were launched.
Lines represent outcome, with green for successful, red for failed, and yellow for canceled fundraisers.
The Y axis is the total count of theater campaigns
The X axis is the month each theater campaign was initually launched

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Below is a visualization to demonstrate fundraiser outcomes for plays based on each play's fundraising goals.
Lines represent outcome, with blue for successful, orange for failed, and grey for canceled fundraisers.
The Y axis is % of outcome
The X axis is the dollar amount bin range from zero all the way up to $50000

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
With no personal knowlede of fundraising, and no expert feedback it is difficult to know 
if the data set is a true and honest representation of data needed to make an accurate analysis.

## Results

- Outcomes based on Launch Date:
-- 
Based on the analytics of theater fundraisers outcomes compared to the launch date, 
I would recommend a Spring time launch, with most theater fundraisers being successful when launched in May.
I would also recommend avoiding fall and winter launching, 
where it appears to more inclinded to fail, possibly as most folks might be saving funds for the winter holidays.

- Outcomes based on Goals:
-- 
Based on the analytics of the success of a play fundraiser compared to its initial funding goal, less is more.
The less money needed, the more inclined to raise the money

- Dataset Limitations:
--
The supplied kickdstarter dataset was limited to a sample only, and not a full population. 
The dataset did miss some compenents that might also influence the failure or success of a fundraiser, 
such as how each campaign was marketed, or what metro area the fundraiser was in.

- Further analytics:
-- 
Additional visual analytics of the length of time each fundraiser had
might prove helpful also in making decisions on future fundraising.
